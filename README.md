## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Seun, a Software Developer.

##### A little about me:
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.
- ðŸ”­ You can find one of my mobile applications, which was built with flutter, that converts the prices of various crytpocurrencies to their equivalent in various major currencies
- [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theseuntaylor.cryptoconverter). Also working on various other applciations built with Kotlin and Java.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone on building mobile applications and contributing to open source projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for opportunities that would enable me grow as a mobile developer, so please, do not hesistate to reach out. ;)
- ðŸ’¬ You can always ask me about anything that you'd like to know.
- ðŸ“« And I can be reached via mail at: seun.gtaylor@gmail.com.
- âš¡ A fun fact about me is when I'm not building mobile applications or finding and squashing bugs, would be that I am either playing a mind-puzzling game, enjoying art & music or deeply engrossed in a book or podcast.
